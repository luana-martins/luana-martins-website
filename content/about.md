Hello! 👋 I am <span style="color: #F08080; font-weight: bold;">Luana Martins</span>, 
a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Salerno (UNISA). I am working under the supervision
of [Prof. Dario Di Nucci](https://dardin88.github.io/) in the [RECHARGE](https://spencerlabaq.github.io/projects/2023-recharge/) project 
that proposes a novel framework for automating performance testing in CI/CD pipelines by leveraging static analysis and search-based algorithms.

In 2024, I concluded my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Brazil, 
under the supervision of Prof. Ivan Machado and co-supervision of Profs. Heitor Costa and Fabio Palomba. 
Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree (2017) and Bachelor's degree (2019) in Computer Science at the 
Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), Brazil. My research during this period focused on various aspects of 
Software Engineering, including Test Code Quality, Test Smell Detection, Test Code Refactoring, and 
Social Aspects in Test Code 
Development.

As part of my academic journey, I had the opportunity to be a visiting Ph.D. student at the UNISA in 2023. During this time, 
I conducted research in the SeSa (Software Engineering Salerno) Lab under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Palomba. 
I have been honored to receive the ACM-W scholarship award and Best Paper awards from prominent Latino-American 
conferences such as Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering (CIbSE) and Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES).
I have also served as a Teaching Assistant in Software Engineering courses and actively participated in conferences 
as a presenter and student volunteer in International COnference on Software Engineering (ICSE) besides other ones.
I have extended my involvement in academia by serving as a reviewer for MSR Junior PC 2024, Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development
2024, and Science of Computer Programming journal 2023/2024.
